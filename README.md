# Assignment-7
I think for my final project I'm going to try and create a database that stores external web information about artists. Whenever doing research about bands I try and find as many biographies and histories as possible. If they were all in one place I think that would be better. 
The site will have credible links for bands and for members within the bands 

A header 
A field where you type an artist's or band's name. 
A button to submit the input. 
A table that pops up with basic information on the band/artist. 
A bunch of links to credible articles and biography sources 


Basic html 
Coding for button and date 
Create event 
Find/ research links 
Add CSS
